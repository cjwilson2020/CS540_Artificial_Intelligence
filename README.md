# CS540_Artificial_Intelligence
This is a collection of projects displaying essential A.I. algorithms. 
These include Neural Networks to classify handwritten-digits, 
Decision trees with alpha-beta pruning to diagnose whether a patient has some disease based on their symptoms and medical test results,  
A simple Markov chain model based on a movie script to generate new sentences that hopefully contain sensible words maybe even phrases, 
An estimate of a parametric models of virus spread using k-means clustering, 
And a maze where I compare multiple uninformed and informed search algorithms to solve it.
